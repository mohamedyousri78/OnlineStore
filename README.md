## Plaining and Design
we simulated the whole process of software engineering.
starting from requirement analysis till the testing and QA.
we wrote user stories, and made UML usecase diagrams for each requirement.
Then we mapped them into activity diagrams and sequence diagrams. For the software architacture we designed a componant diagram.
and for the software design we made a class diagram and ER diagram for the database design.
after implementing the project we run the designed Testcases and assured the quality of the app.

The associated plaining and design diagrams was uploaded on the this drive link:
